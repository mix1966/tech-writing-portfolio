    <title>What is Valid GDSL Code</title>
    <shortdesc>How to write valid GDSL code</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>While GDSL is a simple scripting language, it gives users a lot of flexibility with
            authored image and data files. There are rules to writing valid GDSL code, however:</p>
        <ul id="ul_pln_clf_4rb">
            <li>If and Else are the only branching/conditional statements.</li>
            <li>There is no iteration or recursion as there are no 'for' or 'while' loops.</li>
            <li>There are no functions.</li>
            <li>All variables are global in scope.</li>
            <li>Braces must be used for any statements/expressions longer than one line.</li>
        </ul>
        <codeblock id="codeblock_jpg_kmf_4rb">
if (ConUSElevation &lt;= 3)
output.blue = 128;
else
{
output.red = ConUS.red;
output.green = ConUS.green;
output.blue = ConUS.blue;
}</codeblock>
        <p>Sample Valid GDSL program</p>
        <p>Once you have entered GDSL code into the Editor, you click Validate to make sure it is
            well-formed and valid. If it is valid then the button's color will change to green and
            if not, the button's color will be red.</p>
